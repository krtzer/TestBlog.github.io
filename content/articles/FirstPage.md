Dearest reader, thank you for taking the time to look at this experiment. I hope you find knowledge, wisdom, truth or, at the very least, entertainment in my pursuits and struggles. 

# Motivation 

There are several books I read that affected me in a way such that I wanted to act. Antifragile by Nassim Nicolas Taleb was the first in the series and then the Misbehavior of markets by Benoit Mandlebrot provided a structure and language for describing the complex interactions between components of a system. I loved Misbehaviors of markets so much that I gave my copy to my brother and bought it again to use it as a refernece. The blog is an attempt to better understand the concepts I learned from those books and apply them in a way to help me better understand the world. Or, At the very least, to look at it in a different way. 

I plan to do this is through experimentation. Many of the concepts discussed in the books were easy to understand but difficult to visualize. I normally need to struggle through the concepts by actually implimenting them to fully understand their implications. The blog is my real-ish time process including all the road blocks. Some of it's going to be painful, I'm sure. For this first post, I am going to discuss all the problems I ran into while trying to create this setup on a Windows Systems.

# Tools I want to play with:
* Mathematica
* Git
* Markdown
* Python
    * Shapley
    * PySound
    * Numpy
* Visual Studio Code
* etc

# Ultimate concepts I want to understand better:
* Fractals 
* Random variables
* Probability Density functions 
    * And their properties. For example, The difference between power laws and normal distributions. 
* Self-Similarity
* Mathematical Proofs
* Audio compression
* Signals
* Matrixes



## This is what I hope a sub-title looks like (#python)

Doing FFTs in in python and using it as a tool is great.
