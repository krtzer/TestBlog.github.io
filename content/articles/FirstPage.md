Hi everyone and thank you for looking at this experiment. The goal of these series of posts is to explore a few mathematical concepts and experiment with tools that make 

Tools I want to play with:
* Mathematica
* Git
* Markdown
* Python
    * Shapley
    * PySound
    * Numpy
* Visual Studio Code
* 

## This is what I hope a sub-title looks like (#python)
